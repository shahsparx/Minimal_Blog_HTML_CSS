	<p>This is a catalog of algorithmic problems that arise commonly in practice. It de-
	scribes what is known about them and gives suggestions about how best to proceed
	if the problem arises in your application.
	What is the best way to use this catalog? First, think about your problem. If
	you recall the name, look up the catalog entry in the index or table of contents
	and start reading. Read through the entire entry, since it contains pointers to other
	relevant problems. Leaf through the catalog, looking at the pictures and problem
	names to see if something strikes a chord. Don’t be afraid to use the index, for
	every problem in the book is listed there under several possible keywords and
	applications. If you still don’t find something relevant, your problem is either not
	suitable for attack by combinatorial algorithms or else you don’t fully understand
	it. In either case, go back to step one.
	The catalog entries contain a variety of different types of information that have
	never been collected in one place before. Different fields in each entry present
	information of practical and historical interest.
	To make this catalog more easily accessible, we introduce each problem with
	a pair of graphics representing the problem instance or input on the left and the
	result of solving the problem in this instance on the right. We have invested con-
	siderable thought in creating stylized examples that illustrate desired behaviors
	more than just definitions. For example, the minimum spanning tree example illus-
	trates how points can be clustered using minimum spanning trees. We hope that
	people will be able to flip through the pictures and identify which problems might
	be relevant to them. We augment these pictures with more formal written input
	and problem descriptions to eliminate the ambiguity inherent in a purely pictorial
	representation.</p>
